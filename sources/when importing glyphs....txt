Steps to import a glyph to Fontforge:
Within Inkscape:
* Always scale up glyphs before importing to FF to avoid inconsistent scaling.
* If the glyphs are easily lined up in the outline viewer, instead of doing
  glyphs one-by-one, you can paste everything into FontForge and then clean
  them all up afterwards.
1. Duplicate the glyph & scale up (scale: 800/411)
2. Cut
Within FontForge:
3. Paste
4. Snap the bottom-left corner of the left sidebearing to the bottom left of the glyph
5. Drag the advance width to line up as closely as possible to the right sidebearing
6. Make sure to round the advance width up/down consistently between similar glyphs (if unsure, round down)
7. Delete sidebearing marks
8. Drag the headline on the right side (if applicable) to line up exactly with the advance line (don't do this
   if the headline is meant to overlap between glyphs)
9. Clean up the glyphs: ("DOXY")
   - Correct Direction (Ctrl+Shift+D)
   - Remove Overlap (Ctrl+Shift+O)
   - Add Extrema (Ctrl+Shift+X)
   - Add Points Of Inflection (Ctrl+Shift+Y) (may need to clean up extra points on straight lines)
   
If many glyphs need to be imported, do it in chunks:
1. Scale and port glyphs into FF
2. Set sidebearings, delete markers, then DOXY
		Don't do it all at once because it makes checking for extra points more annoying
