Steps to import a glyph to Fontforge:
Within Inkscape:
* Scale up glyphs Before importing to FF, to preserve granularity before rounding.
* Instead of doing glyphs one-by-one, you can paste everything into FontForge and then
  clean them all up afterwards.
1. Duplicate the glyph & scale up (scale: 2048/411)
2. Cut
Within FontForge:
3. Paste
4. Snap the bottom-left corner of the left sidebearing to the bottom left of the glyph
5. Drag the advance width to line up as closely as possible to the right sidebearing
6. Make sure to round the advance width up/down consistently between similar glyphs (if unsure, round down)
7. Delete sidebearing marks
8. Drag the headline on the right side (if applicable) to line up exactly with the advance line
9. Clean up the glyphs: (Ctrl+Shift+DOXY)
   - Correct Direction (Ctrl+Shift+D)
   - Remove Overlap (Ctrl+Shift+O)
   - Add Extrema (Ctrl+Shift+X)
   - Add Points Of Inflection (Ctrl+Shift+Y) (skip if it addes extraneous points)
   
Alternatively:
1. Scale and port glyphs into FF
2. Set sidebearings and delete markers
3. DOXY glyphs
