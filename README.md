# sorazora_serif
Sorazora Serif. Maiden font of Xymyric 9. This font is out of date and should not be used; please use Natsum√© Serif of Xymyric 10 instead.

Word spacing should be used on all-caps (disconnected) text. Otherwise the spacing is too tight.

The font looks awful in the Windows Font Viewer, but don't worry; it looks fine in other settings.
I don't know what it is with OTF fonts that makes the font viewer render it all jaggedy-like.
